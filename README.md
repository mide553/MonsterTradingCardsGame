The Monster Trading Cards Game (MCTG) is a REST-based server application built in C#. 
It serves as an API for a trading and battling card game, allowing users to register, log in, manage their cards, and compete against one another. 
This project focuses solely on the server-side logic, leaving the frontend development for future work.
